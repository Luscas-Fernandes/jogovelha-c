## All make commands, how to run:

- Default Make:
The default make command will generate a binaries directory, all the object files inside this directory and then the executable file game at the root directory

- Make clean:
Make clean will remove all the generated binaries, directory and executable

## Game modes:

- Tic tac toe:
Conventional tic tac toe, currently the only one available.

- Dynamic tic tac toe (coming soon):
Dynamic tic tac toe consists of normal tic tac toe, but every time you assign your fourth mark on the table,
your first one turns into unassigned space on the table, making the game more dynamic, not the usual who starts probably will win.

## Contribution to new game modes:
If you'd like to see new game modes that you have thought of, please let me know filling an issue on this repo, with the title being
the new gamemode name and the description explaining it. New game mode will be evaluated and its name also might be tweaked.
